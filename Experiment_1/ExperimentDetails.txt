1. Take original image, resize to 50*50, using imresize function of MATLAB.

2.. Make another image which is low pass filtered(use fft/gaussian) and a different image altogether (glpf1_k(image,1))

3. Make a program that blurs a random matrix 5 times and 10 times ---  glpf1_k()

---creates reference patterns

4. In program preprocess ---
   -- rgb2ycbcr
   -- extract y

5. In program correlation
   -- find std. deviation of reference pattern with I
   -- find covariance
   -- find correlation

Images.mat contains 10 images(first load then,for eg. for 1st  Images(:,:,1))

Similarly FiltImages

In refpat.mat
refpat(:,:,1)=Random pattern of [0 1];
refpat(:,:,2)=Random pattern with glpf_1(,1)
refpat(:,:,3)=Random pattern with glpf_1(,2)
refpat(:,:,4)=Random pattern with glpf_1(,5)
refpat(:,:,5)=Random pattern with glpf_1(,10)
